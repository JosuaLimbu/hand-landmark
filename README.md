Hand landmark is a technology used to detect and track specific points on the human hand in images or videos, often used in hand gesture recognition, human-computer interaction, and augmented reality (AR). This technology utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) to identify and track the positions of the fingers and other hand parts. A popular framework for this is MediaPipe by Google, which offers real-time solutions for hand tracking, landmark detection, and gesture recognition using pre-trained deep learning models. MediaPipe can detect up to 21 key points on each hand, enabling applications like device control through gestures, intuitive human-computer interaction, and realistic hand integration in AR environments.
